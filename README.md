## Features

## Assumptions and Limitations

- Data source is the public REST Countries API
- Theme preference (light/dark) is saved in browser localStorage
- No backend or authentication included; frontend-only application
- Responsive design tested on common screen sizes only

## Approach Notes

- React functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo)
- Tailwind CSS with manual dark mode toggling via class on <html>
- Modal implemented via conditional rendering and fixed positioning
- Responsive grid layout using Tailwindâ€™s grid utilities (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)
- Dark mode toggle button uses inline SVG icons for sun and moon
